    <h1>Development Workflow with Git</h1>
    <h2>Projects</h2>
    Here are some projects that I have worked on
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="https://studio.trinsic.id/">Trinsic Studio</a> - Studio for developers to build their own Self Soverign Identity Solutions and issue verifiable credentials and present zero knowledge verification proofs
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries">Hyperledger Aries</a> - allows trusted online peer-to-peer interactions based on decentralized identities and verifiable credentials. Aries includes a protocol definition, tools, and reference implementations. The Aries protocol supports identities rooted in a variety of distributed ledgers or blockchains. This approach to identity is often called Self Soverign Identity (SSI).
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://manifold.picolabs.io">Manifold</a> - a platform for every day users to connect to interact with things. Make anything smart!
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/Picolab/pico-engine">Pico Engine</a> - an engine to spin up a easy and simple decentralized and distributed network of nodes called PICOS (Persistent Compute Objects). Great for decentralized and distributed servers and NoSql Graph Databases.
      </li>
    </ul>
